**Hello, :wave: my name is Kevin Arvai. I'm a data scientist with 10+ years of experience in the genomics field.**

**Connect** :handshake:  
Since you're here, let me know you stopped by. Share your Python or data science story with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvkevi) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinarvai/). I love hearing about what people are working on in the open-source community!

**Favorite project** :dna:  
I wrote a [dashboard app](https://github.com/arvkevi/ezancestry) that predicts users' genetic ancestry from their 23andMe data.

**Non-GitHub stuff** :computer:  
I like machine learning, open-source software/data, and genomics.
